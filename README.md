##Pull Requests
Our current policy on pull requests is as follows:

1. If it doesn't work, we won't accept it.
2. You must provide unit tests for all new methods.
3. You must use American English spelling conventions, contributions with spelling mistakes will not be accepted.
4. Each new individual feature should be squashed into a single commit, so we can easily rollback code that causes errors
