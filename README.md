##About
Due to the relocation of a similar project from Bukkit, a group of developers assembled by taiwe2 got together to create
a new fully customizable and extensible RPG plugin for Bukkit.

The team members are: YoshiGenius, B2OJustin, and Ranzdo.

##Pull Requests
Our current policy on pull requests is as follows:

1. If it doesn't work, we won't accept it.
2. You must provide unit tests for all new methods.
3. You must use American English spelling conventions, contributions with spelling mistakes will not be accepted.
4. Each new individual feature should be squashed into a single commit, so we can easily rollback code that causes errors
5. Post the full server.log (startup to shutdown) of a server running purely this plugin and any other dependencies. Do not omit anything.

##Documentation
See the javadocs at [Legends JavaDocs](http://jd.yoshigenius.com/apidocs/legends/)
and the usage docs at the wiki: [Legends Wiki](https://github.com/Legends-Dev/Legends-Core/wiki)

Note: The links above may change at any time, but forwards will hopefully be set up.
