Legends Core
====

##About
Due to the absense of Heroes from Bukkit, a group of developers assembled by taiwe2 got together to create the new Heroes, Legends.

They are: YoshiGenius, B2OJustin, and Ranzdo.

##Pull Requests
Our current policy on pull requests is as follows:

1. If it doesn't work, we won't accept it.
2. We need a paste of the server.log on pastebin before it will be accepted.
3. If there are any spelling mistakes anywhere in the code, it will not be accepted.
4. Please keep the pull request in separate commits for different features, so we can easily rollback code that causes errors.

##Documentation
See the javadocs at [Legends JavaDocs](http://jd.yoshigenius.com/apidocs/legends/)
